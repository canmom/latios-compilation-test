# latios-compilation-test
Test project to investigate compilation of the Latios Framework on Android.

Contains animated model from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/). If the project works correctly, when compiled and run on a Quest 2/3/Pro headset, you should see an animated character rendered using Kinemation.
